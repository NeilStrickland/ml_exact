# Small exact neural network models

This repository contains code for small neural networks with various different architectures, 
which are designed to solve various simple problems.  In some cases we have neural networks with 
hand-specified weights which solve the relevant problem exactly.  In some cases we have models
that are trained using the usual kind of iterative procedure based on gradient descent.  In some 
cases we have both kinds of models, and we attempt to compare and contrast them.
